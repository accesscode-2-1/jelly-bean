### Retrospective

**Tasha**

*  Goal 2 weeks ago:
* - read some java code and get external sources
* - read more tech posts
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)
* - Successfully, completed weatherclock and got a really good grade
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)
* - Haven't been as motivated to self learn.
* What is your goal for next week?
* - To do really well on the assessment so she can go into Android with optimal knowledge
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)
* -  coming up with shorter more efficient code.

**Hanbi(Hans)**

* Goal 2 weeks ago:
* - Study more and be more fluent in my code
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)
* - Watched videos and learned a few new things. Started reading a java book and Hans is about 70% done with bootcamp problems
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)
* - He needs to work on self learning and motivating self to code in different environment
* What is your goal for next week?
* - Develop a habit of self learning and self seeking
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)
* - Motivation

**Ramona**

* Goal 2 weeks ago: 
* - to review anything we learned thus far
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)
* - Pretty confident with coding and having fun with the bonus challenges. Enjoyed the one on one talk
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)
* - The group project didn't meet Ramona's expectations, mainly due to the pressure of time.
* What is your goal for next week?
* - Have the bonus challenges done. Wants to add ReadMes to the GitHub Repos
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)
* - What's the best convention in putting checks for Null pointer exceptions

**Jose**

* Goal 2 weeks ago:  
* - come back!! 
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)
* - Did most of the required bootcamp exercises. Running and eating well which helps in everything.
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)
* - Could have finished more exercises but still need to review some concepts
* What is your goal for next week?
* - Catch up on reviewing HashMaps and other topics
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)
* - HashMaps and figuring how to set up solving a problem

**Anthony**
* Goal 2 weeks ago:
* - eat more brain food.
* What went well (what goals did you meet?)
* - I ate a bunch of Almonds and other sources of protein while coding at home which probably help (How can you tell?)
* What could have gone better (what were some challenges you faced? Did you overcome them? How?)
* - I could have used more of a break from coding since I had to code for hours over the break for my school assignments.
* What is your goal for next week?
* - Finishing the more of the challenging bonus exercises
* What do you need help with? (peers sign up to help if they can)
* - More ideas for brain food

### Think piece discussion (team leader has prepared answers and guides discussion)

* What are 2 things you took from this think piece?
* - It's important to have a more diverse workforce in tech
* - Anyone can make it and "disrupt power structures" with code
* How does this think piece relate to access code?
* - Anything you make, even if its not for profit, can help you and others become successful in the future
